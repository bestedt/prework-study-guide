  # Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

    The purpose of the Prework Study Guide is to provide myself with a quick reference to the basics that will be used in the bootcamp.
    My motivation in building this project was to establish and learn basic skills required during the bootcamp.
    This project solves the issue of me digging through the modules to find information I may require during the bootcamp.
